# Go4Lunch
Project 7 : Android app dev training - Openclassrooms

## Target
This repository is an Android collaborative app designed to be used by company employees.
It helps them to find restaurants in their surroundings, to select one and to consult restaurants selected by their colleagues in order to join them for lunch.
Shortly before lunchtime, the application notifies employees reminding them the restaurant they selected and workmates they are having lunch with.

## Motivation
This app is the seventh project part of the [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/) training course that I am pursuing in order to become an Android application developer.
This project targets to consolidate the acquired knowledge and concepts and work on different technologies, such as:
- Firebase (authentication, firestore, storage, functions...)
- REST APIs (Google Play Services APIs)
- Retrofit
- Repository pattern
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- Permissions
- Notifications
- etc.

This project applies [AOSP Java Code Style](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/code-style#follow-field-naming-conventions).
