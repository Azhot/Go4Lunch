# Go4Lunch
Project 7 : Android app dev training - Openclassrooms

## Target
This repository is an Android collaborative app designed to be used by company employees.
It helps them to find restaurants in their surroundings, select one and consult restaurants selected their colleagues in order to join them.
Shortly before lunchtime, the application notifies employees so that they can join their workmates for lunch.

## Motivation
This app is the seventh project part of the [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/) training course that I am pursuing in order to become an Android application developer.
This project targets to consolidate the acquired knowledge and concepts and work on different technologies, such as:
- Firebase (authentication, firestore, storage, functions...)
- REST APIs (Google Play Services APIs)
- Retrofit
- Repository pattern
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- Android permissions
- etc.

## Code style
The project uses [AOSP Java Code Style](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/code-style#follow-field-naming-conventions).
